Feature: Change Password
  In order to use a developer portal using an ldap user registry securely
  I need to not be presented with the change password form when I can't use it.

@api
Scenario: Change password is not available as andre user.
  Given users:
    | name              | mail              | pass                  | status |
    | @data(andre.name) | @data(andre.mail) | @data(andre.password) | 1      |
  Given consumerorgs:
    | title                     | name                     | id                     | owner             |
    | @data(andre.consumerorg.title) | @data(andre.consumerorg.name) | @data(andre.consumerorg.id) | @data(andre.name) |
  Given I am logged in as "@data(andre.name)"
  And I go to "/user/@uid/change-password"
  Then the response status code should be 403
  And I should see the text "You are not authorized to access this page."

@api
  Scenario: Change password is not available as a user with an administrator role.
  Given I am logged in as an "administrator"
  And I go to "/user/@uid/change-password"
  Then the response status code should be 403
  And I should see the text "You are not authorized to access this page."

  Scenario: Change password form is not available if not logged in
  Given I am not logged in
  When I go to "/user/1/change-password"
  Then the response status code should be 403
  And I should see the text "You are not authorized to access this page."

@api
Scenario: Change password form is available as admin (uid=1) user
  Given users:
    | name              | mail              | pass                  | status |
    | @data(admin.name) | @data(admin.mail) | @data(admin.password) | 1      |
  Given I am logged in as "@data(admin.name)"
  And I go to "/user/1/change-password"
  Then the response status code should be 200
  Then there are no errors
  And there are no messages

@api
Scenario: Change password form for andre is not available to admin (uid=1) user
  Given users:
    | name              | mail              | pass                  | status |
    | @data(admin.name) | @data(admin.mail) | @data(admin.password) | 1      |
    | @data(andre.name) | @data(andre.mail) | @data(andre.password) | 1      |
  Given consumerorgs:
    | title                     | name                     | id                     | owner             |
    | @data(andre.consumerorg.title) | @data(andre.consumerorg.name) | @data(andre.consumerorg.id) | @data(andre.name) |
  Given I am logged in as "@data(admin.name)"
  And I go to "/user/@uid(@data(andre.name))/change-password"
  Then the response status code should be 403
  And I should see the text "You are not authorized to access this page."
