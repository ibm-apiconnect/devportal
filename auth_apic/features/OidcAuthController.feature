Feature: Sign in/ Sign up via an OIDC provider
  In order to use the developer portal
  I need to be able to Sign in via an oidc provider.
  This tests the controller that receives the redirect from
  the authorization provider via apim.

  Scenario: Valid sign in using oidc provider.
    Given I am not logged in
    And I am at "/ibm_apim/oauth2/redirect?code=validauthcode&state=czozOiJrZXkiOw=="
    Then I should be on "/"
    And there are no errors
    And there are no warnings
    And there are no messages

  Scenario: Invalid - no authcode in params
    Given I am not logged in
    And I am at "/ibm_apim/oauth2/redirect?state=czozOiJrZXkiOw=="
    Then I should be on "/"
    And there are errors
    And I should see the text "Error: Missing authorization code parameter. Contact your system administrator."
    And there are no warnings
    And there are no messages

  Scenario: Invalid - no state in params
    Given I am not logged in
    And I am at "/ibm_apim/oauth2/redirect?code=czozOiJrZXkiOw=="
    Then I should be on "/"
    And there are errors
    And I should see the text "Error: Missing state parameter. Contact your system administrator."
    And there are no warnings
    And there are no messages
