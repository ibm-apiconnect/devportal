Feature: CredentialsCRUD
  In order to use the developer portal
  I need to be able to add, update and delete credentials to existing applications

  # needs to run in zombie driver cos goutte seems to cache the webpage meaning the updated node is not shown
  @api
  Scenario: As Andre, I can add, update, and delete application credentials
    Given I am not logged in
    Given users:
      | name  | pass     | mail              | status |
      | Andre | Qwert123IsBadPassword! | andre@example.com | 1      |
    Given consumerorgs:
      | title       | name        | id     | owner |
      | andreconsumerorg | andreconsumerorg | 123456 | Andre |
    Given I am logged in as "Andre"
    Given I do not have any applications
    Given I am at "/application/new"
    And I should see a "#edit-title-0-value" element
